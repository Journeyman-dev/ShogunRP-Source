# ShogunRP Source

This is the source code of ShogunRP module for Mount and Blade: Warband. It was used for Felix's LegionRP server in the summer of 2017. The code is built upon the persistent world module by Steven Schwartfeger (Vornne) which can be found [https://github.com/vornne/pw_module_system](https://github.com/vornne/pw_module_system). The mod itself, along with all asset files, can be downloaded from Nexus Mods: [https://www.nexusmods.com/mbwarband/mods/6162](https://www.nexusmods.com/mbwarband/mods/6162). All coding was done by Daniel Valcour (Journeyman, known as Ramaraunt back when this was made), who worked with others to help with artwork and map design.

# Features

On top of the original features built into Persistent World, ShogunRP module adds the following:

* New props and equipment, with meshes taken from various mod creators (with their permission). The new weapons and armor were balanced with the help of community testers.
* Over 10 new kinds of food, with methods of production. This includes rice, sake, cabbages, carrots, potatos, mushrooms (with poisinous and rare truffle variants), soy beans (and sauce), and sushi. These foods have different stations placed around the default map where they can be gathered, grown, cooked, and crafted.
* A hunger system, requiring players to occasionally eat food to not starve to death. This can be disabled in the module configuration file.
* A disease system, where players can gain various aliments and conditions such as drunkeness, the common cold, the flu, and the plague.
* A necromancy system, which admins can use to raise players as undead NPCs and then command them.
* Balance changes to the existing PW money chest thievery system to enourage more players to utilize it and incentivize player factions to leave money in the chests to defend, while also providing factions with passive income.
* Costumes which admins can spawn for roleplaying as various mythical creatures.
